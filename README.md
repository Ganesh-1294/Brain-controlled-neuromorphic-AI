This project implements a Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)â€“based control algorithm for smooth and adaptive robotic motion. The DWT is used to decompose motion signals into multiple frequency bands, enabling precise control and noise suppression in robotic movement.

# Key Features

Wavelet-based signal filtering for accurate motor control

Adaptive trajectory correction using DWT coefficients

Smooth motion with reduced vibration and control noise

MATLAB/Python implementation (supports PyWavelets or Simulink)

# Workflow

Acquire motion or sensor data

Apply DWT for multi-resolution analysis

Extract features (approximation & detail coefficients)

Generate filtered control signals for motor actuation

# Applications

Mobile robot path tracking

Robotic arm motion smoothing

Underwater/marine robotic systems

# Tools

MATLAB / Simulink

Python (NumPy, PyWavelets)

Arduino / Raspberry Pi (for hardware validation)
